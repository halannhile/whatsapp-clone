### Future work: 

This app is not perfect since I just wanted to learn as many technologies as I can in a limited amount of time (finished this build in 1 week). In the future, I'd like to add the following features for the app: 

* Authentication with Google Sign-in option so that many people can use this app at the same time, chatting in the same room! 
* Dynamic rooms with the option to create, delete and join rooms
* Clickable buttons for attaching files or for searching rooms
