### Whatsapp clone project to practice building a full-stack web app using the MERN stack

### Link to app: 
* note: currently, the MongoDB database is still linked to localhost:9000, so you can't use the app with your device at the link below just yet, but check back later when I've finished linking the final app's url to the database and you should be able to use the app as seen in the app demo section below!

### Future work: 

This app is not perfect since I just wanted to learn as many technologies as I can in a limited amount of time (finished this build in 1 week). In the future, I'd like to add the following features for the app: 

* Authentication with Google Sign-in option so that many people can use this app at the same time, chatting in the same room! (for now, I have to use Postman to send messages from the other person's perspective)
* Dynamic rooms with the option to create, delete and join rooms. Room info should also reflect last seen at and last message.
* Clickable buttons for attaching files or for searching rooms
